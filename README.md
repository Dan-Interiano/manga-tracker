# Manga Tracker

# Usage
For users who want to make a personal list of Manga titles that they want to read or have already read, and want somewhere online to keep it stored.
The site hosts a landing page that will lead the user to the manga page that pulls from a Sinatra backend database of manga titles and loads them to the page.
With each manga title, there is informationn such as the author and publisher name. On every manga there will be a link towards the review page where users will be able to leave a review of any title which will update the backend database with Sinatra.

# Roadmap
In the future I plan to integrate a star rating system for more detailed information. With personalization in mind, a category sorting method that separates the titles by genre, publisher ete., will also be a key feature.
